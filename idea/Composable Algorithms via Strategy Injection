### **Specification: Composable Algorithms via Strategy Injection**

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Status:** Proposal

#### **1. Abstract**

This document specifies a framework for treating algorithms not as monolithic implementations, but as **composable contracts** whose core operational logic is supplied at design-time. This approach, termed **Algorithmic Dependency Injection**, separates the abstract, structural logic of an algorithm (e.g., the traversal pattern of a search) from the concrete, domain-specific operations it performs (e.g., how to compare two business objects).

The primary goal is to shift developers from manually implementing algorithms to declaratively composing them, allowing an intelligent tooling layer to select the most optimal concrete implementation based on explicit constraints and data properties.

#### **2. Core Entities**

The system is defined by two primary entities: **Contracts** and **Strategies**.

##### **2.1. Algorithm Contract (`AlgorithmContract`)**

A **Contract** is a formal, high-level definition of an algorithmic task. It is a pure interface that specifies *what* the algorithm achieves and what domain-specific operations it depends on, but makes no assumptions about *how* it is implemented.

**Schema:**

```yaml
# A formal definition of an algorithmic family, e.g., "Sorting".
id: "contract:search"
family: "Search"
description: "A contract for finding an element within a data structure."

# Defines the data signature for any implementation.
interface:
  inputs:
    - name: "collection"
      type: "Iterable<T>"
      description: "The data structure to search within."
    - name: "target"
      type: "T"
      description: "The element to find."
  outputs:
    - name: "result"
      type: "Optional<T>"
      description: "The found element or null."

# The "Dependency Injection" slots. These are the core operations that
# a developer must provide (the "business rules").
required_operations:
  - id: "match"
    description: "Determines if a given element is the target."
    signature: "(element: T, target: T) -> bool"
```

##### **2.2. Algorithm Strategy (`AlgorithmStrategy`)**

A **Strategy** is a concrete, swappable implementation of a **Contract**. It provides the actual algorithmic logic (the "skeleton") that orchestrates the `required_operations` supplied by the user. Each Strategy has a "passport" of its performance characteristics and guarantees.

**Schema:**

```yaml
# A specific implementation of a contract, e.g., "Binary Search".
id: "strategy:search.binary_search"
family: "Search"
description: "Implements search via divide-and-conquer on a sorted collection."

# Links this strategy to its formal interface.
implements: "contract:search"

# The verifiable "passport" of this specific implementation.
# This metadata is used by the orchestration engine for optimal selection.
properties:
  complexity:
    time:
      average: "O(log n)"
      worst: "O(log n)"
    space: "O(1)"
  
  preconditions: # Constraints that the input data must satisfy.
    - "input:collection must be sorted"

  invariants: # Guarantees about the process.
    - "The original collection is not modified."
```

#### **3. The Orchestration Workflow**

The framework operates in a three-stage process: **Declaration**, **Injection**, and **Synthesis**.

##### **3.1. Stage 1: Declaration (The "What")**

In a design environment (e.g., a manifest file or a visual graph editor), the developer declares their **intent** by selecting an `AlgorithmContract`, not a specific `AlgorithmStrategy`.

**Example Manifest Entry:**

```yaml
# Developer wants to find a user, but doesn't specify HOW.
- step: "find_target_user"
  uses: "contract:search"
  inputs:
    collection: "all_users_list"
    target: "current_user_id"
```

##### **3.2. Stage 2: Injection (The "Business Rule")**

The system identifies that the `contract:search` requires an operation named `match`. The developer provides (or "injects") the domain-specific logic for this operation. This is the only piece of imperative code they write.

**Example Injection (TypeScript):**

```typescript
// The developer provides the business logic for matching a user.
provideOperation("find_target_user", "match", (user: User, id: UserID): bool => {
  return user.id === id;
});
```

##### **3.3. Stage 3: Synthesis (The "How")**

An intelligent **Synthesis Engine** (the "Compiler" or "AI Agent") performs the final assembly. Its goal is to select the optimal `AlgorithmStrategy` that satisfies the `AlgorithmContract`.

**Decision Logic:**

1.  **Filtering:** The engine first filters all available `AlgorithmStrategy` entities that `implements: "contract:search"`.
2.  **Constraint Matching:** It then analyzes the context and constraints:
    *   It inspects the properties of the input `all_users_list`. Is it sorted? (Checks metadata from a previous step).
    *   It checks for explicit performance requirements in the workflow definition (e.g., `constraints: { max_latency: "50ms" }`).
3.  **Optimal Selection:** Based on the context, the engine makes a choice:
    *   **If `all_users_list` is sorted:** It selects `strategy:search.binary_search` due to its `O(log n)` efficiency.
    *   **If `all_users_list` is unsorted:** It falls back to `strategy:search.linear_search` (`O(n)`) and may issue a warning: "Performance can be improved by sorting the input data first."
4.  **Code Generation:** The engine takes the code skeleton from the selected strategy (e.g., the Python implementation of binary search), and injects the developer-provided `match` function into it, producing the final, executable code.

#### **4. Benefits of the Architecture**

1.  **Separation of Concerns:** Algorithmic logic is cleanly separated from domain-specific business rules.
2.  **Declarative Intent:** Developers focus on *what* they need to accomplish, not *how* to implement it.
3.  **Automated Optimization:** The choice of the best algorithm is deferred to an automated, context-aware engine, eliminating premature optimization and human error.
4.  **Verifiability:** Each `Strategy` can be formally verified against its `Contract` and properties, ensuring system-wide correctness.
5.  **Extensibility:** New, more efficient `Strategies` can be added to the system without requiring any changes to the existing business logic.
